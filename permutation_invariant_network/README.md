# Permutation Invariant Network

PyTorch implementation for [Permutation Invariant Network](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3243734.3243834). This implementation has been tested to recreate experimental results from the original paper (more information [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03699.pdf))
